# cv-lung-classification
The goal of this portion of the project was to create an image classification model using AWS Sagemaker and state of the art deep learning models. This model would be able to infer whether any given coordinate in a histological sample of a rat lung is an alveoli, septa or duct. 

Having an inference tool has many benefits, including reducing subjectivity of classification that may occur between different individualâ€™s labelling. Instead, the classification model is trained off of labelling information provided by a single individual with assumed expertise.

Some other benefits include; an efficient way to classify tissue components a high level of accuracy, consistency, low level of bias and without tying up human resources on a time consuming and tedious task.

Model/hardware specs:
Pretrained ResNet-18 architecture with Adam optimizer and a mini-batch size of 32. The model is also leveraging MXNet as the deep learning framework, utilizing CUDA and GPU acceleration (specifically a Tesla K80 GPU).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
