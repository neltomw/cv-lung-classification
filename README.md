# cv-lung-classification

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a pixel by pixel image classification model using AWS Sagemaker and state of the art deep learning models. This model would be able to infer whether any given coordinate in a histological sample of a rat lung is an alveoli, septa or duct. 

Having an inference tool has many benefits, including reducing subjectivity of classification that may occur between different individualâ€™s labelling. Instead, the classification model is trained off of labelling information provided by a single individual with assumed expertise.

Some other benefits include; efficiency with a high level of accuracy and precision.

### Model/hardware specs:
Pretrained ResNet-18 architecture with Adam optimizer and a mini-batch size of 32. The model is also leveraging MXNet as the deep learning framework, utilizing CUDA and GPU acceleration (specifically a Tesla K80 GPU).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Node v18
* AWS account

### Getting Started
* Make sure NVM (Node Version Manager) is installed
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```
Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. 
The script clones the nvm repository to ```~/.nvm```, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file ```(~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc)```

* Load nvm:
```
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" 
```

* Install nvm
```
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```
### How to run
* Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/neltomw/cv-lung-classification-tool.git
cd cv-lung-classification-tool
```
* Enter your AWS credentials in App.js
const env = {
 "ACCESS_KEY": "*",
 "SECRET_KEY": "*",
 "REGION": "*"
};
